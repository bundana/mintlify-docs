## Overview

Contacts are the people you send messages to. Groups help you organize contacts for targeted campaigns.

## Managing Contacts

### Creating Contacts

Add contacts individually via the API:

```json
{
  "phone_number": "233241234567",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### Contact Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `phone_number` | Yes | International, local, or with + prefix |
| `first_name` | No | Used for personalization |
| `last_name` | No | Used for personalization |
| `email` | No | Contact's email address |

## Working with Groups

Groups allow you to organize contacts for targeted messaging.

### Creating a Group

```json
{
  "name": "VIP Customers",
  "description": "High-value customers for premium campaigns"
}
```

### Assigning Contacts to Groups

You can assign multiple contacts to multiple groups in one request:

```json
{
  "contact_ids": ["1", "2", "3"],
  "group_ids": [
    "ee9fb0b4-83f0-4be5-a0be-1063e05ff0b8",
    "feab58b8-df74-435e-ae09-d7dde096ff0c"
  ]
}
```
