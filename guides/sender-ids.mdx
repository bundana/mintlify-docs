## What is a Sender ID?

A Sender ID is the name or number that appears as the sender when recipients receive your SMS or voice messages. Using a branded Sender ID helps recipients identify your business.

<Note>
  Sender IDs must be approved before they can be used. The approval process typically takes an hour or 24-48 hours.
