## Creating a Campaign

### 1. Choose Recipients

You have two options for selecting recipients:

- **Direct Phone Numbers**: Specify a list of phone numbers directly
- **Contact Groups**: Select one or more groups from your contacts

<Note>
  Phone numbers can be in international format (e.g., `233241234567`), local format (e.g., `0241234567`), or with a plus prefix (e.g., `+233241234567`). Local numbers are automatically converted to international format.
</Note>

### 2. Select a Sender ID

Choose an approved sender ID that will appear as the sender of your messages. You can manage your sender IDs in the dashboard or via the API.

### 3. Compose Your Message

Write your message content. You can use placeholders for personalization:

| Placeholder | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `[First Name]` | Contact's first name |
| `[Last Name]` | Contact's last name |
| `[Phone Number]` | Contact's phone number |

**Example:**

```
Hello [First Name]! Thank you for being a valued customer.
```

### 4. Schedule (Optional)

You can send your campaign immediately or schedule it for later:

```json
{
  "scheduled_at": "2026-01-20 09:00:00"
}
```

### 5. Set Up Recurring (Optional)

For regular communications, you can set up recurring campaigns:

```json
{
  "is_recurring": true,
  "recurrence_frequency": "weekly",
  "recurrence_interval": 1,
  "recurrence_ends_at": "2026-12-31 23:59:59"
}
```

## Campaign Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Campaign is queued and waiting to be processed |
| `processing` | Campaign is currently being sent |
| `completed` | All messages have been sent |
| `failed` | Campaign failed to send |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Personalize Your Messages">
    Use placeholders to make your messages more personal. Personalized messages have higher engagement rates.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Before Sending">
    Always send a test campaign to yourself before launching to your full audience.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mind the Timing">
    Consider your audience's timezone when scheduling campaigns. Avoid sending messages too early or too late.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Messages Concise">
    SMS messages are limited to 160 characters for a single segment. Longer messages will be split and may cost more credits.
