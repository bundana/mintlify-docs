## Overview

Message templates help you create reusable messages with dynamic placeholders for personalization. Instead of writing the same message repeatedly, create a template once and use it across multiple campaigns.

## Creating Templates

### Basic Template

```json
{
  "name": "Welcome Message",
  "content": "Hello [First Name]! Welcome to our service.",
  "type": "sms"
}
```

### Template with Multiple Placeholders

```json
{
  "name": "Order Confirmation",
  "content": "Hi [First Name], your order has been confirmed. We'll deliver to your registered phone number [Phone Number].",
  "type": "sms"
}
```

## Available Placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | Example Output |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `[First Name]` | Contact's first name | "John" |
| `[Last Name]` | Contact's last name | "Doe" |
| `[Phone Number]` | Contact's phone number | "233241234567" |
| `[Email]` | Contact's email | "john@example.com" |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Test your templates**: Always send a test message to verify placeholders are working correctly before launching a campaign.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Character limits**: SMS messages are limited to 160 characters per segment. Plan your templates accordingly.
</Warning>

### Template Writing Tips

1. **Keep it concise**: Get to the point quickly
2. **Include a call-to-action**: Tell recipients what to do next
3. **Add opt-out info**: Include unsubscribe instructions for marketing messages
4. **Avoid special characters**: Some characters may not display correctly on all phones
